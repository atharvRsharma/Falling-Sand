A falling sand simulation inspired by Daniel Shiffman's falling sand simulation written in C++ using GLFW and glad functionalities.
Capable of checking for mouse click and drag, press R to reset screen. 
This happens to be my first project in generative programming, it also happens to be terribly optimised and consists of a lot of deprecated files such as the glut and glew dlls.
may or may not be updated from time to time.
NO OOP PRINCIPLES ARE FOLLOWED, ALL CODE LIES WITHIN THE MAIN FILE ITSELF

please feel free to suggest any optimisation or customisation techniques to make this run better.

update 1: added a sense of randomness regarding the placement of sand, now may have an offset of +1 in the x direction depending on the RNG

update 2: added varying colors changing on left button held down to be more in line with Daniel Shiffman's rendition

update 3: added a pause functionality, can pause sand particles mid air with the P button, create sand pixels in a single line with the left mouse click or add a bit of randomness to the direction of sand particles holding right mouse click

FINAL UPDATE 4: added GUI using ImGui to change color intensity and time interval between changing colors. All deprecated files such as freeglut have been removed. May get small updates overtime and a few tweaks here and there but the project is now finished [25-08-2024]
